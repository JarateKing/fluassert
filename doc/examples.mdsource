# Examples

## Basic

We can create simple fluasserts with a variety of methods.

```python
@@include ../examples/basic.cpp
```

The above code will pass fine without any problems, since all the fluasserts are true. An example of failing would look like:

```python
@@include ../examples/fail.cpp
```

Which would output:

```
FLUASSERT| fail.cpp's main (line 5): testVariable should be 2 - but is 1
```
