# Examples

## Basic

We can create simple fluasserts with a variety of methods.

```python
@@include ../examples/basic.cpp
```

The above code will pass fine without any problems, since all the fluasserts are true. An example of failing would look like:

```python
@@include ../examples/fail.cpp
```

Which would output:

```
@@run "../examples/run.sh" "../examples/fail.cpp"
@@output a.exe
@@run rm a.exe
```
